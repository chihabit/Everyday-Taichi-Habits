<h3 id="chistance">1. Chi Stance</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  Place one hand on your heart and feel the calming energy of the hand;
  </li>
  <li>
  Place the other hand below your navel and feel your breath settle down;
  </li>
  <li>
  Feel the inhalations/exhalations from the lower abdomen as deep, smooth and silent;
  </li>
  <li>
  Sense settling down with the pull of gravity to relax; If upright and not intending to sleep, imagine your head suspended from an imaginary string;
  </li>
  <li>
  Observe your mind calming down.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
How do you feel this working on the imagined negative situations mentioned?
</p>

<div class="note">
The rest of the following 7 Chi Habits are best done from being in the inner state and posture of Chi Stance and may also be done simultaneously with one or more of the other Chi Habits.

<h3 id="healingmoves">2. Healing Moves</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  Flowing from Chi Stance, move slowly and gently, with focused intention to clear up the blockages and move the blocked energy that would be caused by any negative feelings affecting you;
  </li>
  <li>
  Movements are either rotating or flexing the joints, twisting and/or extending sections of the arms, legs, neck and spine or the entire body as a whole;
  </li>
  <li>
    A simple example of this is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
      Begin from sitting or standing Chi Stance,
      </li>
      <li>
      Now lift your shoulders as far up as you can gently while inhaling and hold the breath and lift for a few second,
      </li>
      <li>
      Then, gently bring them down very slowly and synchronize with the movement of the exhalation,
      </li>
      <li>
      Repeat for at least three times.
      </li>
      <li>
       Now sense how this magically transforms your tense and stress condition to a positive and restful one.
      </li>
      <li>
      You can now refocus back to simply enjoying your Chi Stance and perhaps practice the Internal Smile, My Dream Me or the Heart Kungfu of Gratitude.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<h3 id="taichiwalk">3. Taichi Walk</h3>

<p>
Tai Chi Walk is great in dealing with the above situations when one is already walking:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  Flowing from Chi Stance, stay focused and alert as you walk towards your destination;
  </li>
  <li>
  Just simply and naturally walk while maintaining the Chi Stance;
  </li>
  <li>
  Keep your focus, you can put a pebble on top of your head and this will remind you to have an upright, alert and awake posture;
  </li>
  <li>
  Rather than brewing with tension and stress, the walk will be an opportunity to disperse the effect of the situation.
  This is also a great practice for nurturing calmness and inner strength.
  </li>
  <li>
  Simultaneously while walking, you can also practice the Inner Smile, My Dream Me or the Heart Kungfu of Gratitude.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="innersmile">4. Inner Smile</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
  Do the Inner Smile together with and to add chi power to all the other Chi Habits; but do the Chi Stance first:
  </li>
  <li>
  It is simply to invoke the smile from the joy in our heart and to expressed this joyful energy throughout our body; 
  </li>
  <li>
  To express this en-ergy throughout the body, simple intend it or imagine feeling this energy of joy or elation radiating from our heart or inner core to every part of our body; 
  </li>
  <li>
  The joy you choose to focus on will neutralize any negative feelings that may have affected you. (it is like washing your hands when you feel you have touched a virus infected object);
  </li>
  <li>
  Imagine a stressful situation from among those stated at the beginning until you can feel its negative Chi. Now recall any image or thoughts that would trigger you to smile.
  </li>
  <li>
  See how the Chi of the internal smile neutralizes the negative energy.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mydreamme">5. My Dream Me</h3>

<p>
Not wallowing on the negative situation you may find yourself in is an empowering choice. My Dream Me habit is diverting your focus towards the hope, excitement and anticipation of your dream becoming an enjoyable reality along with the fun of manifesting it. It is a positive vision of what is a possible for you -
</p>

<p>
How good you can look like, How good you can feel like, and How well you can you aspire to perform?
</p>

<p>
See how this mind set likewise props you up into an energizing Chi Stance
and automatically creates the positive chi of an Internal Smile.

<h3 id="heartkungfu">6. Heart Kung Fu </h3>

<p>
The training of one's heart in the disciplined tradition of Kungfu endows one to have inner toughness against debilitating negative emotions. From negative feeling, do any or all of the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  In a journal writing mode (even just in your mind), describe the situation you are in as if you will report it to your "inner boss" or "higher self" or whoever you will want to have a meaningful conversation about it;
  </li>
  <li>
  This develops a clear understanding of your situation.
  This allows you to have a "handle on your feelings";
  </li>
  <li>
   Additionally, negative situations trigger our "complaining heart" -
  a chi-draining condition;
  </li>
  <li>
  Use this opportunity to develop a "Grateful and Forgiving Heart";
  </li>
  <li>
  These are powerful virtues that work together to open us up to external positive energy from other people and universal blessings, while at the same time unblocking the flow of Chi.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Any time spent on this is a great investment that would reap you invaluable returns.

<h3 id="waterdetox">7. Water Detox</h3>

<p>
Negative feelings are aggravated and triggered by fatigue/ tiredness/low energy, poor blood circulation and toxins in the body.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Get a glass of water and assume the Chi Stance, Internal Smile and Heart Kungfu of Gratitude;
  </li>
  <li>
  Use this vibrantly positive energy to "bless" the water for 1 minute. Simply direct your positive feeling into the water;
  </li>
  <li>
  Drink down the water slowly. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Imagine how this water goes through your bloodstream and makes your blood more fluid-like so it can go through all the tiny capillaries and nourish and clean up the built-up toxins in your body.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Doing this periodically, you can imagine how much more happy and productive your day can be!

<h3 id="kungfood">8. Kung Food</h3>

<p>
The negative effects of countless situations in daily life activities often carry through to the time you eat. This leads to improper digestion and absorption of nutrients, leading to ill-nourishment and build-up of abdominal fat.
</p>

<p>
Rather than being in this state right before eating, imagine then that:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  You do the Tai Chi Walk, Inner Smile and Dream Me on the way to the cafeteria;
  </li>
  <li>
  Take a minute to do the chi stance unobstrusively while seated and have a Grateful Heart for the food before you slowly eat like a gourmet;
  </li>
  <li>
  Bless the water and drink some to refresh yourself. Now, wouldn't you have a very delightful and energizing meal?
  </li>
</ol>
