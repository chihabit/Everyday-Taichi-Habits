<h3>Preventive, Curative and High Performance Training</h3>

<p>
The 8-Chi Habits program is a complete wellness plan for anyone, regardless of age or physical condition. These habits are preventive as they build-up the Guardian Chi and the immune system. They are also curative and therapeutic as they bring about balance and increase the level of Chi - conditions that bring about healing. Finally, they are also for those who consider themselves fit and healthy, but would like to lift their performance levels with heighten awareness, focus and endurance.

<h3>On what is the 8-Chi Habits based on?</h3>

<p>
<b>TCM Formula: Simple Assessment:</b> All of the 8-Chi Habits are base on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) where Qigong belongs to. Tai Chi on the other hand is a martial type of Qigong.
</p>

<div class="note">
Wei Chi is also known as Guardian Energy' that serves like a protective shield against externally induced illnesses.
<br/><br/>
' Guardian Chi is the aura-like energy that radiates beyond the skin of healthy beings. It serves as a "protective shield” against the intrusion of negative or sickness causing forces.
</div>

<p>
As such, each of the Chi Habits helps you reach the peak of health and high performance by working with these simple explanatory equations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>HEALTH:</b> 
    Ample amount of Chi or energy + Inner balance and harmony
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>AMPLE CHI:</b>
    Chi generated is greater than Chi spent and one has sufficient reserves or stored Chi
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>INNER BALANCE AND HARMONY:</b>
    No blockages + No stagnation no pains and annoying discomforts
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Inversely,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Illness &amp; Low Performance:
  Insufficient Chi and/or Imbalance
  and disharmony
  </li>
  <li>
  Insufficient Chi: 
  Chi spent is greater than Chi generated and Chi reserves are depleted
  </li>
  <li>
  Imbalance and disharmony:
  blockages + stagnation pains and discomforts
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
High level of chi means your energy is ample enough to circulate throughout the body. Like water in an irrigation system, it can reach to all areas if the amount is sufficient.
<br/><br/>
High performance level comes from being in the peak of health and in the state of emotional calmness, mental focus and high level of energy.
